- 👋 Hi, I’m @Invincibleeeee (aka Kanhaiya Agarwal)
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in building real-world, impactful software—especially using the **MERN stack**, networking concepts, and system-level coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced **backend architecture**, **microservices**, and how to turn crazy ideas into working projects (Hackathon-style 🧠🚀).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful **open-source projects**, **hackathons**, and tools that help devs code smarter and better (e.g. folder structure generators, smart learning tools, etc).
- 📫 How to reach me: invinciblekrish08@gmail.com | Or just vibe with me right here 👇
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I build apps that not only solve problems—but make judges pause and say **“Wait, what did we just see?!”** 🔥😎
